## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeKit-VDK-AI-rules/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeKit-VDK-AI-rules/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new rule or an enhancement to an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeKit-VDK-AI-rules/issues/new) to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and avoid duplicated work.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added a new rule, ensure it follows the specifications in `RULES-SPEC.md`.
3.  Ensure your code lints.
4.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Rule Files

- All rule files (`.mdc`) must contain a valid YAML frontmatter block as defined in `RULES-SPEC.md`.
- The content should be written in clear and concise Markdown.

We look forward to your contributions!
